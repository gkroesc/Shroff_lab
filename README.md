# Shroff Lab Worm Untwisting and Cell Tracking Project

This repository contains the various codes used by the Shroff lab C. elegans untwisting project. It is split into the following sections:

  1. Image Processing
  2. Untwisting
  3. Model building


## Image Processing
Divided into the following subsections:
- Max Projections
- Registraion
- Intensity Normalization
- Rotate and Slice 
- Deep Learning 

Each folder contains the scripts for performing the different analysis techniques. Instructions are located in the README.md file within the folder.


## Untwisting
Various python codes used to aid in the lineaging and tracking pipelines


## Model Building
This is a submodule that is linked back to AznStevy/C-Elegans-Model-Generation github page. This repository contains all of the code and instructions for building and visualizing the model. It allows for any number of strains that have been fully tracked to be visualized in the model at one time.
