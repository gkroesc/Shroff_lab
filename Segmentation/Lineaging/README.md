# Lineaging

These are the different codes associated with Cell Lineaging using the application AceTree. All the code necessary to run the app as well as set up instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/zhirongbaolab/AceTree.git).  

The ImageJ macro that converts image files into the correct format to load into Acetree can be found [here](https://github.com/gkroesc/Worm_untwisting_project/tree/main/Image_processing/Rotate_and_Slice), in the Image Processing folder of this repository.
