# Deep Learning Networks:

## 3D RCAN
Derived from the paper [Three-dimensional residual channel attention networks denoise and sharpen fluorescence microscopy image volumes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.270439v1). It was trained on datasets found in the (blank) folder that consist of fluorescent nuclei. 

### Download/Training instructions
Download the 3D-RCAN repository from the AiviaCommunity page that can be accessed [here](https://github.com/AiviaCommunity/3D-RCAN.git).
Refer to the requirements.txt file in the repository for creating an environment with the correct packages/versions
- If using your own data to train a new model follow the instructions in the README file
- If using existing model proceed to the next section

### Applying the Model
